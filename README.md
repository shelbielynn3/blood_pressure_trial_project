# blood_pressure_trial_project
A class project investigating the outcome of a randomized controlled trial for a
new blood pressure medication.  
Outcome variables of interest included systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and 
DBP) and hypertension status.

## Table 1
Characteristics of patients in each study arm.

## Figure 1
Change in SBP by study arm.

## Figure 2
Change in DBP by study arm.

## Figure 3
Change in hypertension status by study arm.

## Table 2
Parameter estimates for change in SBP.  
A linear regression model was built with change in systolic blood pressure as the 
outcome variable and study arm and other patient characteristics as predictor variables.

## Table 3
Parameter estimates for change in DBP.  
A linear regression model was built with change in diastolic blood pressure as the 
outcome variable and study arm and other patient characteristics as predictor variables.

## Table 4
Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for post-intervention hypertension status.
A logistic regression model was built with post-intervention hypertension status as the 
outcome variable and study arm and other patient characteristics as predictor variables 
while also controlling for pre-intervention hypertension status.
